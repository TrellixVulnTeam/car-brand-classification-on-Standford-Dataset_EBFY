# car-brand-classification-on-Standford-Dataset
The project uses Deep learning model model to classify car models and uses Keras as a main library 

This Repository has all the required files for classifing various car models and has an accuracy of 82 % on test data. The model classifiy various car models based on Standford 196 car model dataset.

The Model is trained on RESNET-152 Architecture and you can train you own model by using Standford 196 car dataset from their official website Link for the same is : https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html

you can download my own trained weight file from the given link mention below : https://drive.google.com/file/d/129WYRfADCA3B4y4KKwF88r1otBefBV2L/view?usp=sharing
